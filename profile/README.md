# Gates Of Pangea — Music as code!

> "I don't compose. I program sound."

**Gates Of Pangea Lab** is an independent coding co-op where music tracks, sound systems and audio experiments are created using code, trackers and algorithmic thinking.

It's not the notes that matter here, but the structures. Not the inspiration, but the syntax.

## Philosophy

I advocate:

- **Code instead of notes** — Python, Sonic Pi, SuperCollider, TidalCycles, JavaScript
- **Instruments instead of instrumentalists** — DAW, trackers, CLI and DSL
- **Technical thinking instead of academic music**
- **DIY, hacking, glitch, structure, minimalism**
- Against time tracking, corporate collars and musical snobbery
